To calculate biomass for a forest in Tunisia using the allometric equations from the table n° 1, we'll need to follow these steps:

## 1. Identify the Type of Forest
Determine the type of vegetation present in the forest in Tunisia (e.g., dry forest, humid forest, tropical forest, etc.). This will help you choose the appropriate allometric equation.

## 2. Collect Data
Gather the necessary measurements for the trees in the forest. These typically include:
- \( \text{DBH} \): Diameter at Breast Height (cm)
- \( H \): Tree height (m)
- \( \rho \): Wood density (g/cm³)
- \( AGB \): Above-Ground Biomass (kg)
- \( \text{ca} \): Canopy area (m²)

## 3. Choose the Appropriate Equation
Select the allometric equation from the table that corresponds to the forest type and available data. Here are a few examples:

- For a dry forest: 
  \[
  \text{BA} = \rho \times \exp\left(-0.667 + 1.784 \ln(\text{dbh}) + 0.207 (\ln(\text{dbh}))^2 - 0.0281 (\ln(\text{dbh}))^3\right)
  \]

- For a humid forest:
  \[
  \text{BA} = \rho \times \exp\left(1.49 + 2.148 \ln(\text{dbh}) + 0.207 (\ln(\text{dbh}))^2 - 0.0281 (\ln(\text{dbh}))^3\right)
  \]

- For a tropical forest:
  \[
  \text{BS} = 0.489 \times (\text{AGB})^{0.890}
  \]

## 4. Apply the Equation
Substitute the collected measurements into the chosen equation to calculate the biomass. For example, if you are using the dry forest equation:
\[
\text{BA} = \rho \times \exp\left(-0.667 + 1.784 \ln(\text{dbh}) + 0.207 (\ln(\text{dbh}))^2 - 0.0281 (\ln(\text{dbh}))^3\right)
\]

- Measure the DBH of the tree and calculate its natural logarithm.
- Calculate the wood density (\( \rho \)) if it's not already known.
- Substitute these values into the equation to compute the biomass.

## 5. Sum the Biomass
If you have multiple trees, calculate the biomass for each tree using the above steps and sum the values to get the total biomass for the forest area.

### Example Calculation

Assuming you have a dry forest in Tunisia, and you've measured the following for a tree:
- \( \text{DBH} = 30 \) cm
- \( \rho = 0.6 \) g/cm³

Using the dry forest equation:
\[
\text{BA} = 0.6 \times \exp\left(-0.667 + 1.784 \ln(30) + 0.207 (\ln(30))^2 - 0.0281 (\ln(30))^3\right)
\]

First, calculate the natural logarithm of DBH:
\[
\ln(30) \approx 3.401
\]

Then compute each term in the equation:
\[
1.784 \times 3.401 \approx 6.065
\]
\[
0.207 \times (3.401)^2 \approx 2.396
\]
\[
-0.0281 \times (3.401)^3 \approx -1.086
\]

Adding these together with the constant term:
\[
-0.667 + 6.065 + 2.396 - 1.086 \approx 6.708
\]

Then, compute the exponential:
\[
\exp(6.708) \approx 821.44
\]

Finally, multiply by the wood density:
\[
\text{BA} = 0.6 \times 821.44 \approx 492.86 \text{ kg}
\]

So, the biomass for this tree is approximately 492.86 kg.

Repeat this process for each tree in your sample, then sum the individual biomasses to get the total forest biomass.
